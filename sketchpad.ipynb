There were only a few young girls and very few women professors. For example, Laura Nader, sister of the Lebanese American polemicist and politician Ralph Nader, was a longtime professor of anthropology at Berkeley, and she often talked about how she was one of the first female professors there. During the mid-1960s there was a young woman at my college who wanted to pursue a PhD in history, and the department head told her âYou know, I wouldnât advise it. We donât want women in my department.â I also taught for a year in New Haven; there were only two women in my department.

I spent my days in the streets going all over town, on foot, and often I wound up at the Louvre. I had never seen paintings before. There were no museums in Beirut. Today there are exhibitions, but at the time there was nothing. I grew up in a house where there was no telephone, no radio, we went everywhere on foot . . . . I donât regret any of this, itâs just to explain the revelation that painting was for me in France, even more since I was taking classes on aesthetics with professor Souriau. To go to the Louvre for me was like going to the movies. I didnât think of painting in any special way, I simply looked. I remember my very first visit. In the entryway there was the Winged Victory of Samothrace at the stop of the stairs, and it was a revelation.

American campuses have the marvelous feature of being built among trees, most often. In that room there were canvases, paper, brushes, knives. When I took a sheet of paperânot a canvasâshe gave me tubes of colored paint, little tubes left lying on the ground. Right away I found whatâs known as a palette knifeâa painterâs knife, not a kitchen knifeâand I think the object itself, by its nature, allows you to make only flat shapes. So, I didnât start painting with a brush. The brush came later for drawings. I really began with this knife, and it has remained my instrument. The tool you use directs what you do considerably. There is a collaboration between the objects that you use, and this is true beyond painting. Itâs true even in cooking, itâs true with clothes: if you have silk fabric, youâre going to make a different dress than if your fabric is linen. Itâs the same with art: if you use a painterâs knife, youâre not going to make very precise little lines. And itâs the same thing in music: if you play the violin, itâs not like playing the piano. Iâm very sensitive to the role of objects in our lives, to the importance of this collaboration. Thatâs how it is: the fact that I always use a knife explains why Iâve made flat color blocks. At first, I made them very naturally, as they came, instinctually. Itâs like with childrenâyou donât teach them drawing; they paint naturally. We paint naturally, like we speak. This was incidentally the philosophy of that professor. She said: âEveryone can paint, just as everyone can speak.â This doesnât mean that everyone is Picasso, but itâs a language.',\n",

So, I would respond: âLook, when you listen to Beethoven, for example, you donât say that it has no meaning, but you donât explain it either.â The same goes for an abstract painting.

Iâd compare him in importance to Heidegger because what I like in Heidegger is that, despite this feeling of constant abstraction, there is a sensitivity to the world, and Bachelard has this supreme qualityâa sensitivity to the worldâin plain evidence. Bachelard opened up ideas of poetry through his studies of childhood. He is a great poet-philosopher of poetry, very modern in this respect.

It didnât exist before that; there was the Jesuit university in Beirut where all subjects were taught except literature and philosophy. And Gabriel Bounoure, who was sent there by the ministry of foreign affairs, had come as superintendent of French language education in Syria and Lebanon. In 1944, when Lebanon became independent, his position came to an end, and he thought: I must start an institute. Because he was in love with poetry, thatâs what interested him most, and he didnât want a Catholic institution to teach literature and philosophy, he wanted it to stay totally independent. And then of course after, when he left, they added these two missing subjects to the curriculum at the UniversitÃ© Saint-Joseph.\\nGabriel Bonoure taught poetry classes all the time, for the love of it, for pleasure, without looking at the time. For instance, during the Easter vacation, he arrived at two in the afternoon; at five the class was still going, and no one left. He talked, starting with GÃ©rard de Nerval; he read Les ChimÃ¨res, gave commentary, asked questions of the students, and continued with Baudelaire, always Baudelaire. We were being enlightened; we had known nothing and suddenly we read these texts that opened a world to us. So, we were practically electrified by philosophy and poetry. There were twelve pupils to begin with, and the school grew bit by bit. You realize, to have the luck to meet someone like this, who spoke of poetry for hours and who listened, who asked us questions, who knew each of us personally.\\nUnder his influence I began to write poetry, and I wrote a poem at around twenty years old, entitled âThe Book of the Sea,â because at the time Beirut was a small townâyou saw the sea from everywhere. I never published this poem, and then later, when I left for America, I was facing a new language. It never even occurred to me that I didnât know English. It took me a semester and then I myself was teaching in English. And that was when I became a painter.\\nDuring the Vietnam War, the importance of poetry in the antiwar movement in America was tremendous. American poets today never talk about it; theyâve put aside this period which was a great awakening of poetry. Thereâs a spirit of rebellion in the pioneers of that new poetry like Allen Ginsberg. He was a complete poet, at once lyrical and political. He takes it further; for him, poetry speaks to the entire American culture and the lived reality of Americans. One day, spontaneously, I began to militate against the war. I was horrified by the images of the Vietnam War. I think at the time there was less censorship of images of war. Later, when governments saw the importance of images to public opinion, they became cautious. But at the time the war was broadcast live, and I saw with my own eyes American soldiers with flamethrowers burning Vietnamese villages. You couldnât . . . you couldnât not look. The entire country reacted to these images because they went beyond political analyses. When you see a real war broadcast live, every day, it becomes unbearable. You donât think any more about the reasons for or against. Thatâs when I wrote my first poems, and since they were accepted very quickly, I felt like I fit in with American poetry.',\n",

       "  {'content': 'Yes, necessarily, because Iâve always thought one is traversed by what one lives through. Iâm asked sometimes: âWhy is there so much history of contemporary war in your poetry?â Iâve answered: âBecause itâs not me that writes it, itâs history that writes it.â I have often wanted to think of something besides war, but always another conflict arose. I was born into a family where there were only three of us. My father was an officer of the empire, classmate of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder and first president of the Republic of Turkey. My father had been at the battle of the Dardanelles. At thirty-eight years old his career was over; the Ottoman Empire had disappeared. So, he was a man whose life was somewhat tragic, by reason of history. My mother was much less cultivated than my father, but even more viscerally attached to her Greek world in Turkey. She saw Smyrna burn when she was only twenty-four years old. She thought only of Smyrna. She had stayed there, mentally. When I would go walking along the corniche in Beirut, along the waterfront, I would see huge clouds on the horizon and I would say to my mother, to make her happy: âIs that Smyrna?â I heard talk only of Smyrna. Her friends came to the house and always repeated: âThe grapes were better in Smyrna; the fish was better in Smyrna . . . â She was possessed. She was exiled from her daily life, and she lived in the absence of this city. Her family dispersed: one brother in Salonika, one brother in Cyprus, one brother in Alexandria, a sister in Italy. You see, wars are explosions of families, of lives; and I lived in this repetition of history at home, these stories of interminable war.\\nWe spoke Greek and Turkish in our home. My father didnât speak Greek. But my mother spoke Greek to me very naturally, because it was really the language she knew best. She also spoke a bit of French, and she had learned Turkish, since she was born there. And there were two religions at home: my father was Muslim; my mother was Greek Orthodox. I think Iâve been very lucky to have grown up considering the world to be inhabited by different kinds of people. Itâs an advantage, on account of it being natural. It wasnât something you had to figure out. You even expected that suddenly someone might show up who wasnât quite the same as what you already knew. The Near East in those days was a stopping-off point. It was the end of an empire, with a changing population, and school was French. Under the mandate, we were forbidden to speak Arabic, even at home. I learned it later, haphazardly, in the street. I regret that, by the way. I would have liked to know it better. Anyway, I went to the convent school. The education was very strict. These were very good schools, but they were also a bit narrow. They would say: âPoor little Etel, everything is as it should be, but her father is Muslim.â We were told that Muslims couldnât get into Heaven . . . . I learned to think critically, because at home I heard another side of the story. It was the Greek world; things were more accepted. I was an only child. We would go to Damascus to visit my aunt. There it was still the Ottoman empire. It was another world, the end of a world. And even in Beirut, there was the cosmopolitan neighborhood where I lived, which was no longer solely Christian.\\nWe never went to the other side of the boulevard because we had nothing to do there. There were two or three tramway lines, but we got around on foot most of the time. There were three taxis; you hailed them by pointing a finger. I consider all of that to be a poetic world. Because it was innocent. Everything was in a minor mode. There was no pollution. We were coming out of the Great War; it had taken years. We didnât know where the world was headed; we didnât think it was headed anywhere. We lived each day by itself. We knew only the present. It was an idyllic world, and I was of the first generation of girls to be allowed to swim. I lived through the liberation of women: a very interesting question, because itâs the result of little jumps, as if you were jumping a few meters at a time. At first, there were ten or so little girls who went swimming. Not more than that. And then suddenly, you saw women eating ice cream in the ice cream shop. Thatâs how it took place. In little stages.',\n",

Moreover, youâve celebrated it your whole life, whether it be in poetry, painting, or calligraphy.

       "  {'content': 'Yes. At one time, my parents rented a large house, and I remember my mother telling me: âYou sit on the stool and donât move.â So, I was sitting there like that, for an hour or two, and since I had no brother or sister, I would speak aloud, I would communicate with the garden. There was also a cat, who belonged to my mother, not to me. The house was her house. For Greek wives, the house belongs to them. It doesnât belong to the family; it belongs to the wife. Fathers bleed themselves dry to buy a house for their daughter. If they canât buy a house, they buy an armoire. You see? The daughter must be given a foundation. Itâs more than an object. Therefore, we were in my motherâs house. That really affected me, and it made it so that I spent my life outside, in cafÃ©s and traveling. I was never really at home indoors. This is how I was raised: âDonât move, donât touch. Weâre cleaning the house.â',\n",

       "  {'content': 'I believe the nuns spoke to us about miracles. The education we had was a kind of irrationalismâsometimes charming, sometimes terrifying. We spoke of things that were completely invisible. Paradise, saints, sins; it easily prepares you for a world thatâs a bit surrealist. And I think I was there, dreaming that I worked miracles. What miracles? For example, I would give agency to flowers. Suddenly they could reply to me. These days, being an only child is almost the rule. But in my generation, at school, I was the only girl with neither brother nor sister. So, I watched the world. The world kept me company. I observed. I wanted to step on my own shadow. When returning home from the beach, the sun was such that my shadow was in front of me, and I wanted to step on it. This could be a poem in itself. We donât need to add a thing. To observe the world is poetry. The world is exciting and when you donât have lots of other children around, you speak to yourself, you look around more.\\nThen the Second World War began. My parents were broke, and at sixteen, I went to work in an office while studying for my two baccalaureate exams, at school or in private tutorial. And there, work was a huge discovery. Especially at a time when women were still at home. The world of work is really a second birth. In the first place, you meet people who arenât friends of your parents. Youâre a girl, and you speak to boys. You earn money, even if my mom took it from me, because girls gave their money to the family. You realize, all of this during my own lifetime. Itâs an extraordinary reservoir of poetry. For Beirut, the war was a boom, since wars make fortunes for many people. Everything changes; everything moves very fast. I followed the war with my cohort at the office. We had tacked up a map of the battle of Stalingrad on a large wall. I was even at a press conference that De Gaulle gave in Beirut, and I recorded the conference in shorthand with the secretary of the chief of staff. I was busy, but in a positive way; it was much more interesting than school or home. I had the sense of being active in history, of living it. And then there was the war with Nasser in 1956; the coup dâÃ©tat in Beirut in 1958; the war of 1967; the civil war from 1975 to 1990. For fifteen years we spent our time listening to the war on the radio, so how could I not think about it?\\nIâm like an antenna that picked up what was happening in the world, and suddenly I didnât want to write anymore. I had nothing to say. Our life is determined by big decisions, but on the inside life isnât determined. You can do something this afternoon that you didnât plan to do. You can meet someone who will suddenly change your life without your having known it a few minutes prior. So, chanceâwhether it be inside a painting or in daily life or in artistic decisionsâchance collaborates with us.',\n",
